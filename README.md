# Project Title 
This is a basic project for search and rent out the properties with zero deposit developed using HTML CSS and java script code.

User can search for the property, can explore for the details of the project.
User can select the desired propery and can avail it for rent by paying from the application.
User can also have option to choose the period for which the user want to pay the rent (i.e. 3months 6months, 9months).
user will get new rent offer
user eligibility will be checked 
tools used are html,css,css tailwind,javascript .
technologies used are customer relationship management ,communication tools , machinelearning and AI.
challenges faced while making frontend project was that there was no img src url for pictures ,complex data visualization,cross-browser compatibility,user experience ,real time collaborations problem.
Use HTTPS, end-to-end encryption, and secure authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWTs). Follow GDPR and CCPA compliance for data handling.

to overcome challenges first I found img that can be used it was a time taking process next was 
 *Complex Data Visualization:* Utilize libraries like D3.js and Chart.js for data visualization. Use WebSockets for real-time updates and optimize performance with virtual DOM and caching.

 *Performance Optimization:* Use lazy loading, pagination, and code splitting. Optimize asset bundling with Webpack and use CDNs for faster content delivery.

 *Cross-Browser Compatibility:* Use frameworks like React, Angular, and polyfills. Test across browsers and devices with tools like BrowserStack.

 *User Experience (UX) Design:* Conduct user research, use semantic HTML, and follow accessibility standards (WCAG).

 *Integration with Backend Systems:* Design efficient APIs, handle errors gracefully, and ensure consistent data flow with proper validation.

 *Scalability and Maintainability:* Implement modular architecture, use state management tools (e.g., Redux), and conduct regular code reviews.

 *Security Vulnerabilities:* Sanitize user inputs, use security headers (CSP), and conduct regular security audits.

 *Real-Time Collaboration Features:* Use WebSockets for real-time communication and implement conflict resolution strategies.

 *Third-Party Libraries and Tools:* Choose well-maintained libraries, keep dependencies updated, and regularly audit for security issues.
