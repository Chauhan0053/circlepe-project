technologies used are customer relationship management ,communication tools , machinelearning and AI.
challenges faced while making frontend project was that there was no img src url for pictures ,complex data visualization,cross-browser compatibility,user experience ,real time collaborations problem.
Use HTTPS, end-to-end encryption, and secure authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWTs). Follow GDPR and CCPA compliance for data handling.
to overcome challenges first I found img that can be used it was a time taking process next was error handling in an efficient manner and i was able to make this project . 
I am still working on this project after submission to make it more responsive and functional .
